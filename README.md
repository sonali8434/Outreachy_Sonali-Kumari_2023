# Task 0 for Outreachy Contribution
I want to participate and contribute to a project specifically Moja global because I think my interest closely matches the mission of the project, moja global specializes in software for monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land use and land use change. I previously worked on a similar project called "Sowhat?" in which I made a mobile application using flutter and machine learning models the application uses flutter and dart and for the integration of machine learning models we used TensorFlow decision forest models. My main aim in making this app is to provide farmers with the correct direction toward modern agricultural practices with the help of machine learning. Due to various climate changes, the quality of soil has changed rapidly due to which it is hard for the formers to predict the best crop likely this problem we face major problems due to climatic changes in our day-to-day life climate change has adversely infected all over the globe which includes air pollution, disease, extreme weather events, forced displacement, pressures on mental health, and increased hunger and poor nutrition in places where people cannot grow or find sufficient food. I have made an initiative at a very small level but I want to contribute to the community so that my work can reach a maximum number of people and open source is the best solution for the problem. Specifically talking about my country "India", India comprises a little over 17% of the worldâ€™s population, and it produces just about 7% of global emissions which is insane also I live in Delhi where we see in winter there are extreme cold waves and in summer you can't imagine your life without ac, This year in 2022 over 50 people died in India due to heat wave this is just a small example of the effects of climatic change in India. Although we can dilute the effects of climatic changes by some practices like reducing the flow of heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, by not burning fossil fuels for electricity, heat, or transport, etc.. . I want to contribute to this project with my full potential and contribute my work towards the cause.
